Nibble is a handheld gaming console, designed to follow the aesthetics of the
[Fantasy Console][fc] movement, similar to [PICO-8][pico], [TIC-80][tic],
[LIKO-12][liko] and many, many others.

While it is a real piece of hardware, the SDK and tools to develop and also run
games are available on _Windows_, _Linux_ and _macOS_.
