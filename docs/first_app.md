title: Creating your first Nibble App
---

## The Shell

When you first run Nibble, this is what you will see:

<video width="100%" src="/vid/nibble1-conv.mp4" controls></video>

This is the shell, it can be used to run apps.

For example, you can use the `ls` app to list the contents of a folder:

<video width="100%" src="/vid/nibble2-conv.mp4" controls></video>

Or the `record` app to record your screen:

<video width="100%" src="/vid/nibble3-conv.mp4" controls></video>

## Creating an app

There is an app called `new` which can be used to create apps, you just have to
tell it what is the name of the app you wish to create:

<video width="100%" src="/vid/nibble4-conv.mp4" controls></video>

## Coding your app

Each app needs a function called `draw()` so it can paint anything to the
screen.

To create this function in our new game we use the app `code`:

<video width="100%" src="/vid/nibble5-conv.mp4" controls></video>

`ESC` can be used to bring up the menu, and S/D keyboard keys are mapped to the
_black_ and _white_ shoulder buttons and can be used to either exit the menu or
quit the app while in the menu.

To run our app, we just need to type its name:

<video width="100%" src="/vid/nibble6-conv.mp4" controls></video>
