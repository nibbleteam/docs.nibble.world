title: What is in the package?
---

After downloading the `.zip` for your platform, you will need to extract it,
this will create a new folder.

Inside this folder you will find:

- an executable, this is the nibble emulator
- a `apps/` directory, all your games and system apps are here
- a `frameworks/` directory, the nibble kernel and system libraries go here

## apps/

The `apps/` directory contains all the apps that Nibble uses to create and run
games.

This includes:

- the boot animation
- the menu
- the debug screen
- the terminal
- the shell
- the code editor

and literally everything else that you seen on the Nibble's screen.

## frameworks/

If you want to make some general purpose code that other people will use, this
is where it should go.

All the default APIs are here.
